* **Managing user expectations:** The bot always keeps the end-user apprised of the status of their requests. For example, the bot will notify end-user about the status changes (e.g. from unassigned to assigned). You should also leverage the help tab text to define and set expectations for requestors. For example, if you goal is to answer all queries within 24 hours, mention that within the help tab.

* **Setting your expert team for success:** The success of this app in your organization also depends hugely on the experts team you have. You would want to make sure they can reap the full benefits of this app in helping end-users. Following are the items you should consider:

	* Involve them in the installation process, show them how the full app works - there are three big components - end-user bot; bot notifications in the general channel of the team; Messaging extension that enables experts to quickly shift through assigned/unassigned request.

	* Set up expectations with end-users and empower the specialists to deliver those expectations. For example, ensure that all queries do get resolved within 24 hours or the end-user is apprised of what's taking longer than usual. This will build confidence and you'd have returning end-users.
